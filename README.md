# Dog-Breed-Identification-via-Deep-Learning

- Data Preprocessing (Python, CNNs): Developed an image classifier using Python and Convolutional Neural Networks to accurately differentiate between "dogs" and "not dogs," as well as to identify specific dog breeds from a dataset of 10,000+ dog images.
- Modeling (TensorFlow, Keras): Conducted a comparative performance analysis of three CNN models (AlexNet, VGG, ResNet) implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The VGG model emerged as the best performer.
- Results (Numpy, SciPy): Achieved a 100% accuracy rate in "dogs" vs "not dogs" classification and 93.33% accuracy in breed identification. The effectiveness of the classification process was bolstered by the use of pre-trained CNNs from the ImageNet database and evaluated using NumPy and SciPy for statistical analysis.
